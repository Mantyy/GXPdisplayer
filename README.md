# GXPdisplayer V1.0
Displays hypixel GXP per member! good for finding guild members slacking off or that should be rewarded for their GXP contributions!

**Usage:**
`Click clone or download and press download zip`
*note: your browser may say this file is not safe, just press download anyways*

`extract the .zip file in a empty folder`
*go onto hypixel and type the command /api new*
*save the key it gave you, it should look like this “0a000b00-00c0-00d0-0e00-0f000gh00i00”*

`open the guildxp.exe`
*note: it may give a windows protection screen, just press read more and click on run
anyways*

a black box will appear asking you for your api key, paste / type in the key you just recieved via the hypixel command

Now just type a guild you want to see the exp of and all users will start appearing in the box
Thats it, now when you are done you just close the window!


***(A file will be generated name API_KEY this will hold your key so when you share this program, make sure to remove the API_KEY file)***

***MOJANG HAS AN API RATE LIMIT OF 600 requests/10 min SO IF YOU HAVE A LARG GUILD YOU CAN'T RUN IT MORE THEN $ TIMES IN A !) MIN PIRIOD!
THIS MAY BE WHY IT WON'T WORK FOR YOU.***
