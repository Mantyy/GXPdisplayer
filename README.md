# GXPdisplayer V1.0
Displays hypixel GXP per member! good for finding guild members slacking off or that should be rewarded for their GXP contributions!

**Usage:**
`Download and extract the .zip`

`Click on guildxp.exe`

`If it's your first time using opening the exe it will ask you for an API key`
*You get can get an API key by joining mc.hypixel.net and typing /api new*

`Then it will ask you for a guild name and you simply input the guild name and the computer does the rest!`

***THE MOJANG API HAS A RATE LIMIT OF 600 REQUESTS/10 MIN, IF THE GUILD YOU ARE LOOKING UP HAS 125 MEMBERS YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO LOOK IT UP 4 TIMES IN A 10 MINUTE SPAN!*** *This may be why it's crashing when you input a guild name*
