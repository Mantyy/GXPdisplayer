# GXPdisplayer
Displays hypixel GXP per member! good for finding guild members slacking off or that should be rewarded for their GXP contributions!

#Usage:
open api_key.py and replace "key" with your api key (leave the "")!

then open command promt in that directory and type: py guild.py
it will ask for a guild name and just enter the guild you want to look up and the file does the rest!

NOTE: mojang api has a limit of 600 requests per 10 min so don't run it more then 4 times if your guild is full or else it won't work
